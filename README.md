# Privacy Policy for Name Days Bulgaria
Effective Date: February 04, 2026

1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy describes how Aleksandar Mironov ("we," "our," or "us"), as an individual developer, handles information in the Name Days Bulgaria (Именни дни) Android mobile application. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring a transparent user experience.

2. Information We Collect
We do not personally collect or store any "Personally Identifiable Information" (PII) such as your name, email address, or phone number on our own servers. However, the app uses third-party tools (like AdMob) that collect specific technical data.

- Device Identifiers: Our app uses the Android Advertising ID (AAID). This is a unique, user-resettable ID for advertising, provided by Google Play services. Users can reset or delete their Advertising ID at any time through their device settings.

- Technical Data: To ensure app stability and ad delivery, the following may be collected automatically:

- IP Address (used to estimate general location like city/country).

- App crash logs and performance diagnostics.

- User interactions with advertisements.

3. Third-Party Services (AdMob)
We use Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob uses the data mentioned above to:

- Serve personalized and non-personalized ads.

- Analyze the effectiveness of ad campaigns.

- Prevent fraud and abuse.

- For more information, please visit How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services. (https://policies.google.com/)

4. GDPR & CCPA Compliance
If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA) or California, you have specific rights regarding your data:

- Opt-Out of Personalized Ads: You can reset your Advertising ID or opt-out of personalized ads via your Android device settings (Settings > Google > Ads).

- Consent: For users in the EU, we utilize a Consent Management Platform to ask for your permission before serving personalized ads.

- Data Access: Because we do not store personal data on our own servers, requests for access or deletion are generally handled through Google’s services and your Google Account settings. 

5. Children's Privacy
Name Days Bulgaria is not directed to children under the age of 16, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

6. Security
All data collected by the Google Mobile Ads SDK is encrypted in transit using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.

7. Data Retention
We do not retain personal data ourselves. Data collected by third-party services such as Google AdMob is retained according to their own data retention policies.

8. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the effective date above.
